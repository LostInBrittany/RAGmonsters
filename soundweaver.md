# Soundweaver

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Sonic Entity
- **Habitat**: Echo Canyons
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First recorded in 2024 by acoustician Dr. Melody Harmonic during a sound-mapping expedition

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.9 meters
- **Weight**: 30 kg (mostly sonic energy)
- **Appearance**: Vaguely humanoid figure composed of visible sound waves that ripple and flow in constant motion. Its form is outlined by blue-purple energy with musical note-like patterns throughout. Has no distinct facial features but communicates through a "face" of harmonic waveforms.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Sonokinesis - Manipulation and generation of sound waves
- **Secondary Power**: Frequency Modulation - Can alter the properties of existing sounds
- **Special Ability**: Harmonic Resonance - Can match the resonant frequency of objects, potentially shattering them
- **Weakness**: Vacuum environments nullify all powers, rendering it nearly powerless

## Combat Statistics
- **Attack Power**: 70/100
- **Defense**: 50/100
- **Speed**: 75/100

- **Weak Against**: Amorphous creatures, Entities without physical form
- **Neutral**: Elemental creatures, Organic creatures

## Behavior and Ecology
Soundweavers are drawn to areas with interesting acoustic properties, particularly natural amphitheaters and echo chambers. They feed on ambient sound energy and can become dormant in extremely quiet environments. They communicate through complex symphonies of sound that can convey detailed information and emotions. They reproduce by creating "sound seeds" - concentrated packets of sonic energy that develop into new Soundweavers when exposed to sufficient acoustic stimulation.

## Notable Specimens
"The Symphony" is a collective of seven Soundweavers that have learned to harmonize their abilities, creating sound phenomena that no single entity could produce. Together they can generate healing frequencies, induce specific emotional states, or create destructive interference patterns that can reshape physical matter.
