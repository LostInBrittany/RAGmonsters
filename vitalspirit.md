## Behavior and Ecology
Vitalspirits emerge in areas with exceptional biodiversity and life energy. They act as caretakers and balancers of ecosystems, helping to maintain harmony between different species. They feed on excess life energy produced by thriving ecosystems but never take more than can be naturally replenished. They communicate through bioelectric signals that can be sensed by plants and animals as intuitive understanding. They reproduce rarely, with new Vitalspirits emerging when an ecosystem reaches perfect balance and generates sufficient excess life energy.

## Notable Specimens
"The Garden Keeper" is an ancient Vitalspirit that has established a hidden valley where evolution has accelerated, producing unique species found nowhere else on Earth. It can communicate with all living things in its domain and has developed the ability to temporarily infuse non-living matter with life essence. It maintains a perfect record of genetic information from thousands of species, preserving biodiversity against potential extinction events.
