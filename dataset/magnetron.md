# Magnetron

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Construct/Artificial
- **Subcategory**: Magnetic Entity
- **Habitat**: Urban/Constructed
- **Biome**: Ferrous Deposits
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Discovery**: First documented in 2024 by geophysicist Dr. Ferris Iron during magnetic anomaly research

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.2 meters
- **Weight**: 450 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of magnetized metal fragments held together by powerful magnetic fields. Body constantly shifts as metal pieces realign. Core is a sphere of intensely magnetized rare earth elements that pulses with blue-white energy.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Magnetokinesis - Control over magnetic fields and ferrous materials
- **Secondary Power**: Electromagnetic Pulse Generation - Can create localized EMPs
- **Special Ability**: Magnetic Attraction - Can pull metal objects toward itself with tremendous force
- **Weakness**: Extreme heat reduces magnetic properties, weakening control by 75%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Metal creatures, Technology-based entities
- **Weak Against**: Heat manipulators, Non-metallic entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Magnetrons form naturally in areas with high concentrations of magnetic minerals, particularly near deposits of magnetite and rare earth elements. They constantly absorb and integrate metal from their surroundings, growing stronger over time. They communicate through modulated magnetic fields that can be detected as unusual compass behavior. They reproduce by carefully cultivating a portion of their core that eventually develops into a new Magnetron when exposed to sufficient magnetic energy.

## Notable Specimens
"The Lodestone Emperor" is an ancient Magnetron that has grown to enormous proportions by absorbing metal from an entire mountain range. It has developed control over electromagnetic forces so precise it can manipulate individual electrons, and has created a sanctuary where metal objects float in complex, constantly shifting patterns.
