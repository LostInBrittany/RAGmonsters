# Vitalspirit

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Spirit/Ethereal
- **Subcategory**: Life Force Entity
- **Habitat**: Terrestrial Wilderness
- **Biome**: Biodiversity Hotspots
- **Rarity**: Very Rare
- **Discovery**: First observed in 2025 by biologist Dr. Vita Bloom during research in pristine rainforest ecosystems

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.3 meters
- **Weight**: 60 kg (mostly energy)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of swirling green-gold energy that resembles flowing sap or liquid life force. Body is semi-transparent with visible currents of energy flowing throughout. Features are suggested rather than defined, with eyes that glow with inner light and limbs that trail into wisps of vital energy.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Vitakinesis - Manipulation of life force energy
- **Secondary Power**: Regenerative Aura - Can accelerate healing and growth in living organisms
- **Special Ability**: Life Bloom - Can rapidly accelerate plant growth and ecosystem development
- **Weakness**: Areas of pollution or death drain its energy, reducing power by 85%

## Behavior and Ecology
Vitalspirits emerge in areas with exceptional biodiversity and life energy. They act as caretakers and balancers of ecosystems, helping to maintain harmony between different species. They feed on excess life energy produced by thriving ecosystems but never take more than can be naturally replenished. They communicate through bioelectric signals that can be sensed by plants and animals as intuitive understanding. They reproduce rarely, with new Vitalspirits emerging when an ecosystem reaches perfect balance and generates sufficient excess life energy.

## Notable Specimens
"The Garden Keeper" is an ancient Vitalspirit that has established a hidden valley where evolution has accelerated, producing unique species found nowhere else on Earth. It can communicate with all living things in its domain and has developed the ability to temporarily infuse non-living matter with life essence. It maintains a perfect record of genetic information from thousands of species, preserving biodiversity against potential extinction events.
