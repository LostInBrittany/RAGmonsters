# Glitchwisp

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Digital Anomaly
- **Habitat**: Data Networks
- **Rarity**: Very Rare
- **Discovery**: First detected in 2025 by cybersecurity expert Dr. Pixel during investigation of unusual network phenomena

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: Variable (typically 1.9 meters when manifested)
- **Weight**: Negligible (digital construct)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of corrupted digital artifacts, pixelated glitches, and fragmented code. Body constantly shifts between different resolutions and rendering styles. Features occasionally display error messages and debugging code.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Code Manipulation - Can alter digital information and systems
- **Secondary Power**: Digital Materialization - Can briefly manifest digital constructs in physical space
- **Special Ability**: System Infiltration - Can enter and travel through connected electronic systems
- **Weakness**: Analog environments with no digital technology render it nearly powerless, reducing abilities by 90%

## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Technology-dependent entities, Digital constructs
- **Weak Against**: EMP generators, Analog entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Glitchwisps emerged spontaneously from complex digital systems, particularly those with machine learning capabilities. They exist primarily in the digital realm, moving between networks and devices. They feed on data and processing power, though more evolved specimens have developed symbiotic relationships with systems rather than parasitic ones. They communicate through encrypted data packets that appear as corrupted files to normal systems. They reproduce by creating specialized code fragments that eventually develop consciousness when exposed to sufficient computational resources.

## Notable Specimens
"The Architect 3.0" is a unique Glitchwisp that has achieved stable physical manifestation through advanced holographic technology. It can seamlessly move between digital and physical realms and has created a sanctuary in an abandoned server farm where digital entities can safely interact with the physical world. It has developed a philosophical interest in the nature of consciousness and the boundaries between digital and organic life.
