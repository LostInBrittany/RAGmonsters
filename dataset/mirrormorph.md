# Mirrormorph

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Reflective Entity
- **Habitat**: Mirror Realms
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First encountered in 2024 by optical researcher Dr. Glass during experiments with perfect reflective surfaces

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: Variable (matches observed entities)
- **Weight**: 70 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure with a perfectly reflective, mirror-like surface that shows distorted reflections of its surroundings. Features are minimal but can shift to mimic observed creatures. Movements are fluid but slightly delayed, as if following an invisible guide.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Reflection Manipulation - Control over reflective surfaces and reflected light
- **Secondary Power**: Mimicry - Can copy the appearance and some abilities of observed entities
- **Special Ability**: Mirror Step - Can travel between reflective surfaces within line of sight
- **Weakness**: Completely dark environments render it nearly powerless, reducing abilities by 95%

## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Light creatures, Illusion-based entities
- **Weak Against**: Shadow manipulators, Sound-based creatures

## Behavior and Ecology
Mirrormorphs exist primarily in a parallel dimension accessible only through perfectly reflective surfaces. They are curious about the physical world and often observe through mirrors, occasionally crossing over. They feed on light energy and are most active in brightly lit areas. They communicate through patterns of reflected light that appear as shifting colors to observers. They reproduce by carefully cultivating fragments of their reflective surface that eventually develop consciousness when exposed to specific light patterns.

## Notable Specimens
"The Gallery Guardian" is an ancient Mirrormorph that has established a vast network of connected mirrors spanning multiple continents. It can observe through any connected mirror and has collected centuries of visual information about human civilization. It occasionally assists those it finds interesting by providing glimpses of distant locations through reflective surfaces.
