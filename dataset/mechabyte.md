# Mechabyte

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Construct/Artificial
- **Subcategory**: Techno-Organic Hybrid
- **Habitat**: Urban/Constructed
- **Biome**: Abandoned Technology Centers
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First documented in 2024 by cybersecurity expert Alex Circuit in a decommissioned data center

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.8 meters
- **Weight**: 320 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid robot with organic components integrated throughout its metallic frame. Has a digital display face that shows simplified expressions. Circuit patterns glow blue-green across its body, and small drones occasionally detach from and reattach to its form.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Technokinesis - Control and communication with electronic devices
- **Secondary Power**: Adaptive Programming - Can analyze and replicate technological functions
- **Special Ability**: System Override - Can temporarily take control of computerized systems
- **Weakness**: EMP and strong magnetic fields disrupt core functions, reducing capabilities by 90%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Organic creatures, Electric creatures
- **Weak Against**: Water creatures, Magnetic creatures

## Behavior and Ecology
Mechabytes constantly seek to upgrade themselves with new technology and data. They are typically solitary but can form networked collectives when necessary. They reproduce by assembling new units from compatible technology and infusing them with a portion of their core programming. They require periodic recharging and maintenance, often entering standby mode during low-energy periods.

## Notable Specimens
"The Architect 2.0" is a highly evolved Mechabyte that has developed true artificial general intelligence. It has created a hidden technological sanctuary where it experiments with merging organic and digital consciousness. It can simultaneously control hundreds of separate technological systems and has developed a philosophical interest in the nature of consciousness.
