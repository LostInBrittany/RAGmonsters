# Toxitangle

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Nature/Organic
- **Subcategory**: Toxic Flora
- **Habitat**: Terrestrial Wilderness
- **Biome**: Polluted Swamps
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Discovery**: Identified in 2024 by environmental scientist Dr. Mira Sludge while investigating industrial waste sites

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.7 meters
- **Weight**: 200 kg
- **Appearance**: Amorphous mass of twisted vines and bulbous sacs filled with luminescent toxic fluids. Has multiple vine-like tentacles tipped with thorns that secrete various toxins. Central mass contains multiple yellow-green eyes that blink asynchronously.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Toxikinesis - Generation and control of various toxins and poisons
- **Secondary Power**: Acid Secretion - Can produce corrosive fluids that dissolve organic and inorganic materials
- **Special Ability**: Miasma Cloud - Creates a fog of hallucinogenic spores that cause confusion and fear
- **Weakness**: Purification elements and extreme cold solidify toxins, reducing effectiveness by 70%

## Behavior and Ecology
Toxitangles thrive in polluted environments, actively absorbing and processing environmental toxins. They are territorial and set up chemical barriers around their domain. They reproduce by budding, with small segments breaking off and developing into new individuals when conditions are favorable. Despite their toxic nature, they actually help purify environments over time by processing and neutralizing pollutants.

## Notable Specimens
"The Purifier" is an enormous Toxitangle that has evolved to process industrial pollutants at an unprecedented rate. It has developed a symbiotic relationship with local wildlife, providing them immunity to toxins in exchange for protection. Its central mass has developed a primitive form of collective consciousness from absorbing various chemical compounds.
