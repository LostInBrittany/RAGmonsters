# Echospecter

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Resonance Entity
- **Habitat**: Acoustic Anomalies
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First detected in 2024 by acoustician Dr. Echo Chamber during research on architectural acoustics

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.0 meters
- **Weight**: 20 kg (mostly sound waves)
- **Appearance**: Translucent humanoid figure composed of visible sound waves that ripple and flow with every noise in its vicinity. Body constantly shifts between visibility and near-invisibility depending on ambient sound levels. Features are suggested by concentrated wave patterns that mimic facial structures.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Echo Manipulation - Control over reflected sound waves
- **Secondary Power**: Acoustic Memory - Can perfectly recall and reproduce any sound it has ever heard
- **Special Ability**: Resonance Cascade - Can amplify sounds to destructive levels by matching resonant frequencies
- **Weakness**: Vacuum environments render it nearly powerless, reducing form stability by 95%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Crystal entities, Structure-based creatures
- **Weak Against**: Silence manipulators, Void entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Echospecters form in locations with unusual acoustic properties, such as ancient amphitheaters, cave systems, or specially designed concert halls. They feed on sound energy and are most active in noisy environments. They communicate through complex harmonic patterns that can convey detailed information. They reproduce by creating "sound seeds" - concentrated acoustic patterns that develop consciousness when exposed to the right harmonic conditions.

## Notable Specimens
"The Symphony" is an ancient Echospecter that has collected sounds from throughout history, preserving acoustic memories that would otherwise be lost to time. It can reproduce the exact sound of extinct species, lost languages, and historical events it witnessed. It has created an acoustic sanctuary where sound itself takes physical form, creating landscapes of pure resonance.
