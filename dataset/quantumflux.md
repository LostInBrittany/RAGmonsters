# Quantumflux

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Anomaly/Phenomenon
- **Subcategory**: Quantum Anomaly
- **Habitat**: Extra-dimensional
- **Biome**: Probability Nexuses
- **Rarity**: Extremely Rare
- **Discovery**: First detected in 2025 by quantum physicist Dr. Heisen Berg during a particle superposition experiment

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: Indeterminate (exists in multiple states simultaneously)
- **Weight**: Fluctuating (follows uncertainty principles)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure that exists in multiple states simultaneously, appearing blurred and indistinct as it shifts between possible forms. Body composed of particles that constantly phase between matter and energy, with wave-like patterns flowing throughout its form.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Quantum Manipulation - Can influence probability and quantum states
- **Secondary Power**: Superposition - Can exist in multiple locations simultaneously
- **Special Ability**: Entanglement - Can quantum-link with other entities to share information instantly
- **Weakness**: Observation by multiple conscious beings forces it into a single state, reducing abilities by 85%

## Behavior and Ecology
Quantumfluxes exist in a state of perpetual possibility, perceiving all potential outcomes simultaneously. They are drawn to areas where reality is thin or where probability behaves unusually. They communicate through quantum information that appears as intuitive understanding rather than language. Their reproduction involves creating quantum entangled "offspring" that gradually develop independent wave functions.

## Notable Specimens
"The Possibility Engine" is a unique Quantumflux that has learned to manipulate probability on a macroscopic scale. It exists in a self-created pocket dimension where all possible outcomes occur simultaneously, and it can selectively collapse wave functions to bring specific possibilities into the primary reality.
