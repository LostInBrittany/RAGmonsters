# Fungalnet

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Mycelial Collective
- **Habitat**: Ancient Forests
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Discovery**: First identified in 2023 by mycologist Dr. Spore during research on fungal communication networks

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: Variable (typically 2.0-4.0 meters when fully formed)
- **Weight**: 150 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of densely interwoven mycelium strands with clusters of various mushrooms and fungi growing from its surface. Body can separate into component fungi and reform at will. Bioluminescent spores constantly emanate from its form, creating a glowing aura.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Mycelial Control - Manipulation of fungal networks and growth
- **Secondary Power**: Spore Generation - Can produce various spores with different effects
- **Special Ability**: Collective Consciousness - Can connect to and communicate with all fungi in an ecosystem
- **Weakness**: Extreme dry conditions cause rapid dehydration, reducing cohesion by 80%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Insect entities, Decay-based creatures
- **Weak Against**: Fire manipulators, Cold-based entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Fungalnets act as the conscious embodiment of forest mycelium networks. They can extend their awareness through connected fungal systems, effectively monitoring entire ecosystems. They communicate through chemical signals and can share information with plant life through mycorrhizal connections. They reproduce by establishing new mycelial networks that gradually develop collective consciousness.

## Notable Specimens
"The Forest Memory" is an ancient Fungalnet that has integrated with a primeval forest for centuries. It maintains a living record of the forest's history stored within its mycelial network and can share these memories as vivid hallucinations with those who consume specific mushrooms it produces. It has developed symbiotic relationships with all life in its forest, creating a perfectly balanced ecosystem.
