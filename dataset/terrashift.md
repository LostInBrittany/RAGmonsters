# Terrashift

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Geological Entity
- **Habitat**: Tectonic Boundaries
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First observed in 2025 by geologist Dr. Stone during an unusual seismic event

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 3.5 meters
- **Weight**: 2,000 kg
- **Appearance**: Massive humanoid composed of shifting layers of rock, soil, and crystal. Its form constantly changes as different minerals rise to the surface and subduct beneath others. Eyes are deep geodes filled with glowing magma.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Geokinesis - Manipulation of earth, stone, and minerals
- **Secondary Power**: Seismic Sense - Can detect vibrations through the ground with extreme precision
- **Special Ability**: Tectonic Shift - Can create localized earthquakes and reshape terrain
- **Weakness**: Separation from ground contact reduces power by 95% within minutes

## Behavior and Ecology
Terrashifts are ancient beings that spend most of their existence in a dormant state, appearing as unusual rock formations. They awaken during significant geological events or when their territory is threatened. They communicate through subtle vibrations in the earth that can be felt rather than heard. They reproduce extremely rarely, with new Terrashifts emerging from specially prepared mineral deposits after centuries of formation.

## Notable Specimens
"The Mountain King" is a colossal Terrashift that has existed for millennia and has become so large it's often mistaken for a small mountain. It can control geological activity across an entire region and has created a network of crystal caves that serve as a sanctuary for mineral-based lifeforms.
