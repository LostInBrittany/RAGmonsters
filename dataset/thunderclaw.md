## Behavior and Ecology
Thunderclaws are nomadic, following storm systems to recharge their electrical reserves. They are primarily nocturnal, using electrical sensing abilities to locate prey during thunderstorms. They reproduce during the most intense electrical storms, with cubs requiring frequent exposure to electrical energy to develop properly.

## Notable Specimens
"Stormheart" is an unusually large Thunderclaw that has developed the ability to create focused lightning strikes from clear skies. It's rumored to be able to communicate with storm systems, calling down targeted lightning at will.
