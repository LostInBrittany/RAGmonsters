# Lumiglow

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Elemental
- **Subcategory**: Light Elemental
- **Habitat**: Terrestrial Wilderness
- **Biome**: Aurora Fields
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Discovery**: First documented in 2024 by physicist Dr. Ray Prism during a study of unusual light phenomena

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.6 meters
- **Weight**: 5 kg (mostly energy)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of brilliant, shifting light in all colors of the spectrum. Core is a concentrated white light that pulses with its heartbeat. Features are suggested rather than defined, with limbs that trail into wisps of colored light.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Photokinesis - Control and generation of light energy
- **Secondary Power**: Chromatic Shift - Can alter the wavelength of light, changing colors and properties
- **Special Ability**: Solar Flare - Can release a blinding burst of concentrated light energy
- **Weakness**: Darkness and void energy can absorb its form, reducing power by 75%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Shadow creatures, Plant creatures
- **Weak Against**: Void creatures, Darkness manipulators

## Behavior and Ecology
Lumiglows are drawn to sources of natural light, particularly auroras, bioluminescence, and solar phenomena. They communicate through pulses of colored light that form complex patterns. They feed on ambient light energy and can enter a dormant state during extended periods of darkness. They reproduce by splitting off portions of their light energy during particularly intense light events.

## Notable Specimens
"The Prismatic Sage" is an ancient Lumiglow that has learned to manipulate light at the quantum level. It can create holographic projections of past events it has witnessed and has developed the ability to bend light around itself, becoming effectively invisible. It serves as a keeper of knowledge, recording events through light impressions.
