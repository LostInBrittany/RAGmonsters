# Graviton

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Anomaly/Phenomenon
- **Subcategory**: Gravitational Anomaly
- **Habitat**: Extra-dimensional
- **Biome**: Gravity Wells
- **Rarity**: Very Rare
- **Discovery**: First detected in 2025 by astrophysicist Dr. Newton Mass during gravitational wave research

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.2 meters
- **Weight**: Immeasurable (distorts measurement tools)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid silhouette composed of warped space-time. Its body appears as a dark outline with stars visible through its form, but distorted as if viewed through a lens. Small objects orbit around its core in unpredictable patterns.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Gravitokinesis - Manipulation of gravitational forces
- **Secondary Power**: Mass Alteration - Can increase or decrease the effective mass of objects
- **Special Ability**: Singularity - Can create a localized gravity well that pulls everything toward it
- **Weakness**: Exposure to exotic matter disrupts gravitational control, reducing power by 85%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Physical creatures, Flying creatures
- **Weak Against**: Energy beings, Quantum entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Gravitons are solitary entities that are drawn to areas with unusual gravitational properties, such as the vicinity of black holes or neutron stars. They perceive time differently than other beings, sometimes responding to stimuli before they occur. They communicate through gravitational pulses that can be detected as subtle weight changes. Their reproduction process is theoretical but appears to involve the careful folding of space-time to create a "gravity bud" that eventually develops into a new Graviton.

## Notable Specimens
"The Event Horizon" is an ancient Graviton that has mastered control over space-time to such a degree that it can create temporary pockets of altered time flow. It resides near a dormant black hole and has developed a philosophical interest in the nature of infinity and cosmic cycles.
