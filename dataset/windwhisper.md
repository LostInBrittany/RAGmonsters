## Behavior and Ecology
Windwhispers are nomadic entities that follow global wind patterns. They communicate through subtle variations in air pressure that sound like whispered voices to those who can perceive them. They feed on kinetic energy and are drawn to areas with strong, consistent winds. During calm weather, they enter a dormant state, becoming nearly invisible.

## Notable Specimens
"The Skyweaver" is an ancient Windwhisper that has developed control over weather patterns across entire mountain ranges. It can create safe passages through storms for travelers it deems worthy and is said to carry messages between isolated mountain communities.
