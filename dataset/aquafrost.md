# Aquafrost

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Elemental Hybrid
- **Habitat**: Glacial Lakes
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Discovery**: Discovered in 2023 by marine biologist Dr. Elena Winters during an expedition to the Frozen Depths

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.8 meters
- **Weight**: 320 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid water entity with crystalline ice formations throughout its transparent blue body. Its core glows with a pulsating cyan light, and ice crystals form a crown-like structure around its head.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Cryohydrokinesis - Control of water and ice simultaneously
- **Secondary Power**: Freezing Touch - Can instantly freeze small bodies of water on contact
- **Special Ability**: Blizzard Veil - Creates a swirling storm of ice and water that obscures vision and slows enemies
- **Weakness**: Heat-based attacks cause rapid evaporation, reducing mass by up to 40%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Fire creatures, Earth creatures
- **Weak Against**: Electric creatures, Wind creatures

## Behavior and Ecology
Aquafrost entities are semi-social, often forming small groups of 3-5 individuals. They communicate through harmonic resonances within their crystalline structures. During summer months, they retreat to deeper waters where temperatures remain cold enough to maintain their ice components.

## Notable Specimens
"The Glacier Queen" is an ancient Aquafrost that has existed for over 150 years, developing the unique ability to create semi-sentient ice sculptures that act as guardians. Her control over water extends to atmospheric moisture, allowing her to create localized weather phenomena.
