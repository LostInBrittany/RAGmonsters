## Behavior and Ecology
Shadowrifts are solitary entities that avoid direct interaction with physical beings. They feed on ambient emotional energy, particularly fear and wonder. They are most active during astronomical events that create unique shadow patterns. Their reproduction is poorly understood but appears to involve the fragmentation of their consciousness during dimensional stress events.

## Notable Specimens
"The Midnight Oracle" is an ancient Shadowrift that has achieved a stable connection between dimensions. It can perceive possible futures and communicates through abstract visions. Those who find it and offer rare knowledge may receive cryptic prophecies in return.
