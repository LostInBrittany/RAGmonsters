- **Rarity**: Extremely Rare
- **Discovery**: First detected in 2025 by astronomer Dr. Stella Cosmos during observations of an unusual stellar phenomenon

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.5 meters
- **Weight**: Negligible (exists partially in higher dimensions)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid silhouette composed of what appears to be a slice of deep space. Its body contains swirling galaxies, nebulae, and stars that move independently of its actions. Eyes appear as bright quasar-like points of intense light.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Void Manipulation - Control over empty space and cosmic energies
- **Secondary Power**: Stellar Channeling - Can harness and direct the energy of stars
- **Special Ability**: Cosmic Step - Can traverse vast distances by folding space
- **Weakness**: Planetary gravitational fields constrain abilities, reducing power by 70% on Earth-like worlds

## Behavior and Ecology
Voidwalkers are nomadic entities that travel between star systems, drawn to unusual cosmic phenomena. They perceive reality on multiple dimensional levels simultaneously and communicate through patterns of stellar energy that can be observed as unusual astronomical events. Their life cycle spans millions of years, with reproduction occurring during rare cosmic alignments when they can channel enough energy to split their consciousness.

## Notable Specimens
"The Celestial Observer" is an ancient Voidwalker that has witnessed the birth and death of countless stars. It has developed the ability to accelerate or decelerate stellar life cycles and maintains a "garden" of unusual star systems throughout the galaxy. It occasionally makes contact with advanced civilizations to share cosmic knowledge.
