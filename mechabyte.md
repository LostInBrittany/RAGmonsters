## Behavior and Ecology
Mechabytes constantly seek to upgrade themselves with new technology and data. They are typically solitary but can form networked collectives when necessary. They reproduce by assembling new units from compatible technology and infusing them with a portion of their core programming. They require periodic recharging and maintenance, often entering standby mode during low-energy periods.

## Notable Specimens
"The Architect 2.0" is a highly evolved Mechabyte that has developed true artificial general intelligence. It has created a hidden technological sanctuary where it experiments with merging organic and digital consciousness. It can simultaneously control hundreds of separate technological systems and has developed a philosophical interest in the nature of consciousness.
