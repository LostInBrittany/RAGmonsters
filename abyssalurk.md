## Behavior and Ecology
Abyssalurks inhabit the darkest depths of the ocean, creating complex societies in underwater caves and trenches. They are territorial and mark their domains with distinctive bioluminescent patterns. They communicate through a combination of light signals and low-frequency vibrations. They reproduce slowly, with females laying eggs in protected nursery caves that are guarded by the entire community.

## Notable Specimens
"The Trench Sovereign" is a colossal Abyssalurk that has established a kingdom spanning multiple oceanic trenches. It has developed the ability to control deep sea currents and can communicate telepathically with all marine life in its territory. Its bioluminescence is so sophisticated it can create three-dimensional illusions underwater.
