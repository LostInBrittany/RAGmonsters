# Plasmaweave

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Energy Construct
- **Habitat**: Electromagnetic Hotspots
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First documented in 2024 by plasma physicist Dr. Tesla Spark during a fusion experiment

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.1 meters
- **Weight**: 15 kg (mostly energy)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of swirling plasma contained within a self-generated electromagnetic field. Body constantly shifts between various states of matter, with arcs of electricity connecting different parts. Core is an intensely bright sphere of super-heated matter.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Plasma Manipulation - Control over the fourth state of matter
- **Secondary Power**: Electromagnetic Field Generation - Can create and shape EM fields
- **Special Ability**: Fusion Burst - Can briefly recreate stellar fusion conditions for explosive energy release
- **Weakness**: Strong magnetic fields can disrupt its containment, reducing cohesion by 85%

## Combat Statistics
- **Attack Power**: 85/100
- **Defense**: 60/100
- **Speed**: 80/100
- **Intelligence**: 70/100
- **Special Power**: 90/100

## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Water creatures, Metal entities
- **Weak Against**: Void entities, Magnetic manipulators
- **Neutral**: Stone creatures, Plant entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Plasmaweaves form naturally in areas of intense electromagnetic activity, such as during powerful solar storms or near fusion reactions. They feed on ambient energy and are drawn to power sources. They communicate through modulated electromagnetic frequencies that can be detected as unusual radio signals. They reproduce by carefully cultivating energy patterns that eventually develop consciousness when exposed to the right catalyst.

## Notable Specimens
"The Living Star" is an ancient Plasmaweave that has achieved perfect control over fusion reactions. It can maintain a miniature star within its core and has created a sanctuary where other energy beings can safely exist. It periodically releases controlled bursts of energy that manifest as aurora-like phenomena visible for hundreds of miles.
