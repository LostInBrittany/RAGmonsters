## Behavior and Ecology
Psyforges exist in areas with high concentrations of conscious thought. They feed on ambient mental energy but can also form symbiotic relationships with willing hosts, enhancing the host's mental abilities in exchange for a stable energy source. They communicate telepathically and can share memories and experiences directly with receptive minds.

## Notable Specimens
"The Architect" is a uniquely powerful Psyforge that has developed the ability to create permanent psychic constructs that persist independently. It has established a sanctuary where thoughts take physical form, and visitors report experiencing shared dreamscapes that can provide profound insights into their subconscious.
