## Behavior and Ecology
Vinelashes form symbiotic communities with local plant life, accelerating growth and protecting forest ecosystems. They are diurnal, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. During drought seasons, they can enter a dormant state, reducing to a seed-like form until conditions improve.

## Notable Specimens
"The Ancient Gardener" is a centuries-old Vinelash that has grown to twice the normal size and developed the ability to control entire forest ecosystems. It can communicate telepathically with all plant life within a 5-kilometer radius and has created a sanctuary where plants exhibit near-sentient behavior.
