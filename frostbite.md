## Behavior and Ecology
Frostbites form naturally in regions of extreme cold where ambient magical energy is present. They are territorial and create elaborate ice structures to mark their domains. They hibernate during warmer months by burrowing deep into glaciers. They reproduce by channeling their energy into ice formations during the winter solstice, which animate as new Frostbites when conditions are right.

## Notable Specimens
"The Winter Monarch" is an ancient Frostbite that has grown to enormous proportions and developed control over weather patterns across entire regions. It can create perpetual winter in its territory and has formed a symbiotic relationship with arctic wildlife, which it protects from environmental threats.
