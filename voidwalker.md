## Behavior and Ecology
Voidwalkers are nomadic entities that travel between star systems, drawn to unusual cosmic phenomena. They perceive reality on multiple dimensional levels simultaneously and communicate through patterns of stellar energy that can be observed as unusual astronomical events. Their life cycle spans millions of years, with reproduction occurring during rare cosmic alignments when they can channel enough energy to split their consciousness.

## Notable Specimens
"The Celestial Observer" is an ancient Voidwalker that has witnessed the birth and death of countless stars. It has developed the ability to accelerate or decelerate stellar life cycles and maintains a "garden" of unusual star systems throughout the galaxy. It occasionally makes contact with advanced civilizations to share cosmic knowledge.
