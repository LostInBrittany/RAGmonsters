## Behavior and Ecology
Dreamweavers exist primarily in the collective unconscious, moving between the dreams of sleeping creatures. They feed on emotional energy generated during dreams and are particularly drawn to vivid dreamers. They communicate through shared dream symbols and can connect the dreams of multiple individuals. They reproduce by cultivating recurring dream patterns that eventually develop consciousness.

## Notable Specimens
"The Nightmare Shepherd" is an ancient Dreamweaver that has mastered the art of nightmare manipulation. It collects and catalogs fears from across the collective unconscious, but rather than exploiting them, it helps dreamers confront and overcome their deepest terrors. It can maintain dream constructs in the waking world for extended periods and has created a sanctuary where dreams and reality seamlessly blend.
