## Behavior and Ecology
Toxitangles thrive in polluted environments, actively absorbing and processing environmental toxins. They are territorial and set up chemical barriers around their domain. They reproduce by budding, with small segments breaking off and developing into new individuals when conditions are favorable. Despite their toxic nature, they actually help purify environments over time by processing and neutralizing pollutants.

## Notable Specimens
"The Purifier" is an enormous Toxitangle that has evolved to process industrial pollutants at an unprecedented rate. It has developed a symbiotic relationship with local wildlife, providing them immunity to toxins in exchange for protection. Its central mass has developed a primitive form of collective consciousness from absorbing various chemical compounds.
