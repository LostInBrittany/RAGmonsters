## Behavior and Ecology
Sandshifters are nomadic entities that follow desert wind patterns. They are most active during the day when the sand is hot and dry, often becoming dormant at night by merging with the desert floor. They communicate through patterns of vibration sent through sand particles. They reproduce by gathering mineral-rich sand into a core that gradually develops consciousness when exposed to sufficient heat and energy.

## Notable Specimens
"The Dune Emperor" is an enormous Sandshifter that has existed for centuries, growing to control an entire desert region. It has developed the ability to create complex structures from sand that remain permanently solid, and can sense everything that occurs on the desert surface within its territory.
