## Behavior and Ecology
Terrashifts are ancient beings that spend most of their existence in a dormant state, appearing as unusual rock formations. They awaken during significant geological events or when their territory is threatened. They communicate through subtle vibrations in the earth that can be felt rather than heard. They reproduce extremely rarely, with new Terrashifts emerging from specially prepared mineral deposits after centuries of formation.

## Notable Specimens
"The Mountain King" is a colossal Terrashift that has existed for millennia and has become so large it's often mistaken for a small mountain. It can control geological activity across an entire region and has created a network of crystal caves that serve as a sanctuary for mineral-based lifeforms.
